Moment
1. Angular acceleration of upper body
2. Moment of inertia of upper body
3. Center of Mass of upper body
4. Load's Weight
5. Moment about low back

Moment of Inertia
1. Calculate the radius of gyration of each 
   body segment according to table 4
2. Calculate the mass of each segment according to 
   table 4
3. Calculate the moment of inertia according to 
   Step 1 and Step 2
4. Apply Parallel Axis Theorem to move the axis along
   the body segment to low back
5. Sum up the total of the moment of inertia of each
   body segment to get the total moment of inertia
   about the low back
